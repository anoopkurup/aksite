## HERO SECTION

**[Eyebrow]**

About Anoop Kurup

**[Headline]**

**I fix foundations, not funnels.**

**[Subhead]**

Most marketing consultants start with tactics. I start with a question: Why isn't what you're doing working?

Usually, the answer has nothing to do with marketing.

---

## THE BACKSTORY

### How I got here

I didn't start in marketing. I started in research.

**Five years at GE Global Research** — working on water purification and clean energy technologies. My job was to understand problems deeply before proposing solutions. To separate symptoms from root causes. To see what others were missing.

**Five years running an IPR firm** — helping companies understand competitive landscapes, protect innovations, and make strategic decisions about where to invest. We built something valuable enough that it got acquired.

**Then I moved into marketing.** Not because I loved campaigns or content — but because I kept seeing the same pattern: smart founders with real expertise, struggling to grow. Not because they lacked skills. Because they lacked clarity.

They were trying to market everything they knew, instead of solving one clear problem for one clear audience.

That's when I realised: marketing problems are rarely marketing problems. They're clarity problems dressed up in marketing clothes.

---

## THE WORK I DO NOW

### Business Clarity Architect

I work with expert-founders of services businesses — consultants, agencies, trainers, professional services firms. People who've built real expertise over 10+ years but find themselves stuck. Dependent on referrals. Unable to grow beyond their network.

The pattern is almost always the same:

They've tried marketing. It didn't work. So they assume they're bad at marketing, or their industry is different, or they just need to find the right tactic.

But the problem isn't tactics. It's that they're trying to fix Layer 3 when Layer 1 or 2 is broken.

**That's where I come in.**

I use the Business Clarity Architecture™ — a diagnostic framework that identifies where growth is actually stuck. Is it Strategy? Positioning? Conversion? The answer determines what to fix — and in what order.

I don't run your marketing. I don't build your funnels. I help you see what's actually broken, then help you rebuild the foundation so that whatever marketing you do actually works.

## WHAT I BELIEVE

### The principles behind the work

**Clarity before tactics.**

Too many businesses jump straight to execution — content plans, ad campaigns, lead magnets — without understanding who they serve, what makes them different, or why anyone should care. Tactics amplify whatever's already there. If there's no clarity, there's nothing to amplify.

**Sequence matters.**

You can't fix Conversion if Positioning is broken. You can't fix Positioning if Strategy is unclear. Most founders try to solve problems at the wrong layer. That's why "marketing doesn't work."

**Foundations compound. Tactics don't.**

A quick hack might get you a short-term bump. A solid foundation keeps working as you grow. I'm not interested in growth hacks. I'm interested in clarity that compounds.

**Expertise isn't enough.**

Being great at what you do doesn't mean clients will find you. Expertise needs clarity to become visible. Otherwise, you're the best-kept secret in your industry.

**Referrals are wonderful — but not a strategy.**

If your growth depends on who happens to mention you this month, you don't have a growth system. You have a network. Networks plateau. Clarity compounds.

## WHO I WORK WITH

### The founders I'm built to help

**Expert-founders of services businesses.**

Consultants, agencies, trainers, professional services firms. People who sell expertise, not products. Businesses built on knowledge and relationships.

**10+ years of experience, 5+ years in business.**

You're not new to this. You've built something real. But growth has stalled, and you're not sure why.

**Solo or small teams.**

Typically working alone or with 2–3 people. No large corporate structure. Decisions happen fast when clarity exists.

**Based in India, usually Bangalore.**

Though the work happens remotely. What matters is the fit, not the location.

**NOT in IT/Software.**

I work with knowledge services and professional services. If you're building software products, I'm probably not the right fit.

---

## WHO I'M NOT FOR

### Honesty saves everyone time

**If you want someone to run your marketing** — hire an agency. I fix foundations, not funnels.

**If you're looking for quick hacks** — we won't be a good fit. I build things that last.

**If you're not willing to question assumptions** — the diagnosis process requires honesty about what's not working. If you've already decided you know the answer, you don't need me.

**If you want a cheerleader** — I'll tell you what I see, not what you want to hear. Kind, but honest.

## THE FRAMEWORK

### The Business Clarity Architecture™

This is the diagnostic system I use to identify where growth is stuck.

```

**The insight:** Most founders try to fix Conversion when the problem is in Strategy or Positioning. Better tactics won't help if the foundation is cracked.

The sequence matters. We diagnose first. Then fix in order.

## HOW I WORK

### Three ways to engage

**DIAGNOSE — Clarity Diagnosis Session**

For founders who aren't sure what's actually broken. A 60-minute session to audit your Clarity Stack and identify the real problem.

**BUILD — Clarity Sprint**

For founders who know what's broken and want to fix it. A 4–8 week intensive to rebuild Strategy, Positioning, or Conversion.

**PARTNER — Ongoing Advisory**

For founders who want a thinking partner as they grow. Monthly retainer with regular sessions and async access.

## A FEW THINGS ABOUT ME

### Beyond the work

I'm based in Bangalore. I've been here long enough to understand how business actually works in India — relationship-driven, value-conscious, reputation-sensitive.

I co-host a podcast called "Click, Brand, and Beyond" with Nisha Prakash. We talk about digital marketing, business building, and life from the perspective of small business owners. India-centric viewpoints, practical conversations.

I read more than I should. I think in systems. I believe most problems have already been solved somewhere — you just need to find the right analogy.

I'm not on social media constantly. I don't post for the sake of posting. When I write, it's because I have something to say.

## READY TO TALK?

### Let's find out what's actually broken

If you're an expert-founder stuck in referral dependence, wondering why marketing isn't working, let's have a conversation.

The Clarity Diagnosis Call is where we start. 30 minutes to understand your situation and see if I can help.

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

**Visual elements needed:**

1. Professional headshot (existing one works)
2. The Clarity Stack diagram
3. Optional: Timeline or journey visual for the backstory section

**Tone alignment:**

- More personal than homepage, but still professional
- Story-driven but not self-indulgent
- Establishes credibility through experience, not claims
- Honest about who I'm not for (builds trust)

**Cross-links:**

- Link to /framework from the Clarity Stack section
- Link to /services (or individual service pages) from "How I Work" section
- Link to podcast page or external podcast link

**Key messages:**

- Research background → diagnostic mindset
- Not a marketing person who learned strategy → strategist who applies it to marketing
- Foundations, not funnels
- Clarity compounds

**Length:** ~1,200 words. Longer than typical about pages, but appropriate for a solo consultant where trust and fit matter.
