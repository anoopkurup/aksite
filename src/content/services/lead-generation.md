  # FAQ
  - type: "faq"
    header:
      title: "Common Questions"
    items:
      - question: "How many conversations can we expect?"
        answer: "Most clients generate 10-20 qualified conversations per month. Response rates depend on your ICP, messaging quality, and offer strength. We optimize continuously to improve results."
      - question: "Do you guarantee a certain number of leads?"
        answer: "We guarantee effort and process, not outcomes (since conversion depends on your offer and close process). We commit to 100-200 researched prospects, personalized outreach, and systematic follow-up."
      - question: "What CRM do you work with?"
        answer: "We work with most major CRMs (HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce, Zoho, etc.). If you don't have a CRM, we can help set one up."
      - question: "How is this different from hiring a sales development rep (SDR)?"
        answer: "An SDR costs ₹6-8 lakh annually plus training and management overhead. This service gives you a complete system — research, outreach, follow-up, optimization — at a fraction of the cost."
