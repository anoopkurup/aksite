    I'm Anoop Kurup — a strategist, consultant, and builder. Over the years, I've worked with founders of knowledge services, technical services, and consulting companies to simplify lead generation and marketing.
    
    I combine **marketing fundamentals**, **systems thinking**, and **AI workflows** to help you scale without chaos — and without burning out.

audience:
  title: "I Work Best With"
  subtitle: "Over 200+ engagements, I've discovered which types of businesses get the most transformative results from systematic marketing approaches."
  intro: "Not every business is ready for what I do. The companies that see dramatic improvements share three characteristics: they value expertise over price, they're willing to invest in systems that compound over time, and they understand that sustainable growth comes from consistent execution, not silver bullets."

      subheading: "Beyond Referrals"
      description: "Marketing agencies, law firms, consulting practices, training companies, and specialized B2B services firms with 10-50 employees. These are businesses built on expertise and relationships, but they've hit the ceiling of what referrals alone can deliver. They need systematic approaches to demonstrate thought leadership, build authority, and generate predictable demand without compromising their professional reputation or appearing 'salesy' to their sophisticated clients."
      results: "40-60% increase in qualified leads within 90 days, 25-35% improvement in close rates through better positioning."

      description: "SaaS companies, IT service providers, digital agencies, and productized service businesses experiencing rapid growth or planning for it. These companies understand technology but struggle with marketing systems that can keep pace with their ambitions. They have solid products and early traction but need marketing processes that scale efficiently, generate qualified leads consistently, and support their sales team with better-qualified prospects."
      results: "50-80% reduction in sales cycle length, 3x improvement in marketing-qualified lead conversion rates."

These are recognized experts in their fields who've outgrown the feast-or-famine cycle of networking and referrals. They want to build personal brands and systematic lead generation that attracts ideal clients automatically, without constant networking, speaking, or cold outreach that doesn't scale."
      results: "2-3x increase in inbound inquiries, 50-70% improvement in project value and client quality."

    I get it. Running a professional service or tech-enabled business means you're an expert at delivering value — but marketing often feels like chaos.

    I help you build a clear, repeatable marketing system rooted in fundamentals, powered by AI workflows, and designed for consistency. Instead of chasing the next tactic, you get a system that attracts, nurtures, and converts your ideal clients — on autopilot.

    With 15+ years of experience across strategy, systems thinking, and AI, I've helped consultants, SaaS firms, agencies, and professional service companies double their inbound leads, shorten sales cycles, and attract better clients.

    **And I can do the same for you — starting with clarity, then building strategy, and finally installing the systems to keep your pipeline full.**
