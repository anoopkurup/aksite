  title: "My Story and Approach"
  content: |
    I started my career in research engineering at GE, where I quickly learned that great products requires a lot of effort to bring to market. I moved into intellectual property analysis, helping companies understand competitive landscapes and protect their innovations. Then I made the leap into building businesses of my own, and that's when I truly understood the marketing challenge firsthand.
    
    This journey taught me that marketing success isn't about following the latest trends or using the fanciest tools. It's about building systems that work consistently, regardless of market conditions or team changes.
    
    For the past 20+ years, I've been helping businesses fix this fundamental problem. Working with over 200 companies, I've developed a systematic approach that transforms marketing from a necessary evil into a strategic growth engine.

  intro: "Not every business is ready for what I do. The companies that see dramatic improvements share three characteristics: they value expertise over price, they're willing to invest in systems that compound over time, and they understand that sustainable growth comes from consistent execution, not silver bullets."

  items:
    - title: "Strategy Before Tactics"
      description: "Marketing should be built on positioning and strategy, not just campaigns and content. Too many businesses jump straight to tactics—social media posts, email campaigns, ads—without understanding who they serve, what makes them different, or where their customers actually spend time. I start with strategy: understanding your market position, ideal customer profile, and competitive advantage. Then we build tactics that reinforce that strategy."
    - title: "AI as an Enabler, Not a Replacement"
      description: "Artificial intelligence is incredibly powerful when used correctly—it can make marketing faster, cheaper, and more consistent. But it's not magic, and it's not a replacement for human creativity and strategic thinking. I help businesses implement AI workflows that enhance their marketing processes while freeing up human time for higher-value strategic work."
    - title: "Systems Win Over Improvisation"
      description: "When marketing is designed as a repeatable process, it creates predictability, accountability, and the ability to scale without proportional increases in effort or team size. Most businesses approach marketing like jazz improvisation—responding to whatever seems urgent that week. I help businesses build marketing systems with documented processes, clear metrics, and workflows that execute consistently."
    - title: "Sustainable Growth Over Quick Wins"
      description: "I'm not interested in growth hacks or superficial tactics that generate short-term spikes. My work is about building marketing systems that create sustainable, predictable growth—the kind that keeps working even when you're not actively pushing new campaigns. This approach creates lasting competitive advantages, not temporary bumps."
